# Smithy template

Use this template to create a new Smithy project:

```bash
cargo generate tyrchen/smithy-template
```

Then rename `_github` to `.github` and change the smithy files, `Cargo.toml` as you like.

If you don't have `cargo-generate` installed, please [install](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate) it first.
